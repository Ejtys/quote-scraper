# quote-scraper
Beautiful Soup and SQLite3 project. Scrapes quotes from quotes.toscrape.com into SQLite3 db.

The program i working. It is over-engineered but that was the point: to get more practice with sql, data and bs4.

I still have not figured out why python can't find path to some modules without that os.path hack...
